{"Question": "Periodontal disease isnt a clear bacterial source?", "Free_form_answer": "Periodontal disease, also known as gum disease, is actually caused by a variety of bacterial sources. It's a bacterial infection that involves the gums, the periodontal ligaments, and the tooth sockets. It starts when bacteria, mucus, and other particles form a sticky, colorless substance known as plaque on the teeth. If not properly removed by daily brushing and flossing, the plaque can harden and turn into tartar. The bacteria in the plaque and tartar produce toxins that stimulate an inflammatory response, causing the gums to become swollen, red, and bleed easily - a condition known as gingivitis. If left untreated, gingivitis can advance to periodontitis, characterized by the gums pulling away from the teeth and forming pockets that become infected. As it progresses, it can lead to tooth loss. Therefore, periodontal disease is very much linked to bacterial sources, and maintaining good oral hygiene is crucial in preventing this condition.", "Must_have": ["Periodontal disease is caused by a variety of bacterial sources.", "It is a bacterial infection that involves the gums, periodontal ligaments, and tooth sockets.", "It begins with the build-up of bacteria, mucus, and other particles forming plaque on the teeth."], "Nice_to_have": ["The bacteria in plaque and tartar produce toxins that cause an inflammatory response, leading to gingivitis, which can then advance to periodontitis if not treated.", "Good oral hygiene is crucial in preventing periodontal disease."], "ICD_10_diag": "Acute lymphadenitis, unspecified"}

Nasacort is OTC (over-the-counter) and tends to be cheaper than Flonase which can also be found OTC or with a prescription.In terms of side effects, Nasacort might have fewer potential side effects compared to Flonase due to the latter's bioavailability. However, this varies individually and not everyone will experience side effects.

The approach to a resistant infection generally involves multiple strategies.Firstly, doctors often wait for lab results to determine the type of bacteria causing the infection to shape the treatment plan. This includes identifying the bacteria and conducting an antibiotic sensitivity test, which determines which antibiotics the bacteria respiratory to and which they resist.Secondly, the use of combination drug therapy may be employed. This involves using two or more antibiotics together to make it harder for the bacteria to resist the effects.Thirdly, the healthcare provider may prescribe newer or more powerful antibiotics to try to overcome the resistance.Lastly, the compliance to treatment is crucial. Patients need to finish the entire course of drugs, even if they feel better.

{"Question": "may i ask the risk to beta blockers?", "Free_form_answer": "Beta blockers, also known as beta-adrenergic blocking agents, are medications commonly used to treat conditions like hypertension (high blood pressure), angina (chest pain), heart attack, and irregular heart rhythm. However, these medications carry certain risks as well.Some common side effects of beta blockers include fatigue, short-term memory loss, weight gain, reduced exercise ability, depression, unusual dreams, and even a feeling of lethargy. In addition, they can cause a slow heartbeat and symptoms of asthma. Beta blockers can also potentially mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia in diabetics, making it harder for them to realize when their blood sugar is dangerously low.In some cases, abruptly stopping treatment with beta blockers can lead to a temporary worsening of heart symptoms like chest pain and heart attacks. Therefore, if you need to stop taking a beta blocker, your doctor will gradually decrease your dose over weeks.", "Must_have": ["Common side effects of beta blockers include fatigue, memory loss, weight gain, reduced exercise ability, depression, sleep disturbances.", "Beta blockers can slow the heart rate and may exacerbate asthma symptoms.", "Beta blockers can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia in diabetics.", "Abruptly stopping beta blockers can lead to a temporary worsening of heart symptoms."], "Nice_to_have": ["Beta blockers are used to treat conditions like hypertension, angina, heart attack, and irregular heart rhythms.", "If needing to stop beta blocker treatment, it should be done under the guidance of a doctor who will gradually reduce the dose."], "ICD_10_diag": "Anxiety disorder, unspecified"}
{"Question": "What is the diff between urinalysis and urine culture?", "Free_form_answer": "Urinalysis and urine culture are two different types of tests that are performed on urine samples. Urinalysis is a test that checks for the presence of cells, cell fragments, crystals, bacteria, and substances such as glucose, protein, and bilirubin in the urine. This test is used to detect and manage a wide range of disorders, such as urinary tract infections, kidney disease, and diabetes.Urine culture, on the other hand, is a specific test to identify and characterize the bacteria or yeast that might be causing a urinary tract infection (UTI). The sample of urine is incubated in a substance that promotes the growth of microbes. After a day or two, the germs (if any) are identified and tested to see which medications will provide the most effective treatment.", "Must_have": ["Urinalysis is a test that checks the presence of cells, cell fragments and various substances like glucose, protein etc.", "in the urine.", "Urine culture is a specific test to identify and characterize the bacteria or yeast causing a urinary tract infection."], "Nice_to_have": ["Urinalysis can help detect and manage a wide range of disorders including urinary tract infections, kidney disease and diabetes.", "A urine culture involves incubating the urine sample in a substance that promotes microbial growth and then identifying and testing the germs to determine the most effective treatment."], "ICD_10_diag": ""}
