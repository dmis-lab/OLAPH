{"Question": "what is the difference between gabbentibe lyrica \"?\" for pain", "Free_form_answer": "Though pregabalin and gabapentin have somewhat similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, there are clearly significant differences. Overall, pregabalin has more predictable pharmacokinetics, and it also shows a stronger binding affinity to its target receptor, increased potency, and a steeper dose-response curve in neuropathic pain that does not plateau over recommended dosing levels. A few studies have found that pregabalin has fewer side effects and may be more efficacious for neuropathic pain than gabapentin. Several studies reviewing conversion of gabapentin to pregabalin predict that a rough ratio for conversion is about 6:1 gabapentin to pregabalin.

{"Question": "what antidepressants are best for someone with a heart arrhythmia", "Free_form_answer": "A research team at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital has verified that several antidepressants may increase the risk of a potentially dangerous heart rhythm disturbance (arrhythmia). By examining the electrocardiograms (ECGs) of more than 38,000 people taking 11 different antidepressants, they confirmed that higher doses of citalopram (Celexa), amitriptyline (Elavil), and escitalopram (Lexapro) were associated with a slight disruption of the electrical function of the heart. This delay as seen on an ECG is known as a prolonged Q-T interval, and it is a risk factor for an arrhythmia that causes sudden death. Although the majority of people with this ECG abnormality never develop an arrhythmia, the researchers cautioned that people taking these antidepressants should discuss the risk with their doctor. The researchers emphasized that no one with a history of arrhythmias should start taking these medications. Instead, such a patient might try one of the antidepressants that do not increase the Q-T interval: fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), or buproprion (Wellbutrin).

{"Question": "how does it take phentermine to clear a drug screen?", "Free_form_answer": "Since phentermine has a similar structure to amphetamines, a urine drug screen can test positive for amphetamines.

{"Question": "is it safe for a 72 year old to stop taking premarin?", "Free_form_answer": "Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.Premarin is a medication that contains conjugated estrogens, which are a type of female sex hormones. These hormones are often used in hormone replacement therapy to help manage symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. They can also help prevent osteoporosis in post-menopausal women.When considering whether it is safe for a 72-year-old woman to stop taking Premarin, it's important to take into account her individual health situation, including any symptoms she may be experiencing, her risk of osteoporosis, and any other medications or supplements she may be taking. It's also important to monitor any potential withdrawal symptoms, as stopping hormone replacement therapy abruptly can sometimes cause symptoms such as hot flashes to return.", "Must_have": ["It's crucial that anyone considering stopping Premarin or any other form of hormone replacement therapy to consult their healthcare provider first.", "The healthcare provider can provide guidance based on the individual's medical history, current health situation, and her risk for conditions such as osteoporosis."], "Nice_to_have": ["It's potentially beneficial for health providers to work with the patient to gradually reduce the dose of Premarin, rather than stopping it abruptly, to minimize any potential withdrawal symptoms.", "However, the most appropriate course of action varies depending on the individual's circumstances, so it's still important to consult with a healthcare provider before making any changes to medication regimens."]}
{"Question": "what are the side effects of taking the two medication amlodipine metoprolol together", "Free_form_answer": "There were six AEs reported in five patients. Peripheral edema 2.97% (3/101) was the most common AE, which was reported in three patients and was related to the study medication, probably to the amlodipine component. All these patients had hemoglobin (Hb) less than 12 g/dL at baseline (one patient had Hb of 11.6 g/dL at baseline, which was 12.1 at end of study and two had 11.7 g/dL which was 11.3 and 12.9 respectively at the end of study). Of these three, one patient had severe peripheral edema and was withdrawn from the study. The patient was followed-up and after a week time peripheral edema was resolved. Peripheral edema of mild and moderate degree was seen in one patient each. In these two patients, edema was resolved and improved respectively. Vertigo, lumbar spondylosis and eosinophilia (considered unlikely due to the study drug), were seen in one patient each and were mild in intensity. Though there were statistically significant changes in sodium, chloride, which showed decrease and blood urea, fasting blood sugar, which were increased, but these were clinically insignificant.

{"Question": "how do steroids effect the respiratory system", "Free_form_answer": "Several efforts have been made to show the beneficial effects of anabolic agents in humans. In malnourished patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) nandrolone decanoate was beneficial in regaining respiratory muscle strength.74Recent data showed an improvement in expiratory and inspiratory muscle strength following treatment with oxandrolone in patients with tetraplegia.75 This increase in muscle strength was attributed to the observed increase in diaphragm muscle mass and resulted in an increased vital capacity. Basin and co-workers showed a beneficial effect of a high dose of testosterone on fat free body mass, muscle size, and peripheral muscle strength in normal men.76 During the 1970s and 1980s several studies were performed to investigate the additional effects of anabolic steroids on a training programme in healthy athletes.

{"Question": "is it alright to use fluticasone when using oxygen", "Free_form_answer": "Pharmacological therapy can influence morbidity and mortality in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival in COPD with chronic hypoxaemia. Oral steroid medication has been associated with improved survival in men and increased mortality in women, while inhaled steroid medication has been associated with a reduction in the exacerbation rate. We have analysed the relationships between pharmacological therapy including oxygen therapy, sex, performance status and need for hospitalization and mortality in 403 patients with COPD (201 men) after their registration in a national oxygen register for LTOT. The mean value of days spent in hospital per year was 44. An increased need of hospital care was independently predicted by a poor performance status, high age and, in women, orally administered steroid medication. Hospital admissions were significantly longer in the terminal stage of COPD among women receiving oral steroid medication. Increased mortality was predicted by a poor performance status and, in women, oral steroid treatment. Predictors of morbidity and mortality during LTOT were found to coincide. The increased mortality in women receiving oral steroid medication was found to be associated with an increased need of hospital care due to longer hospital stays during the terminal stage of the disease.
